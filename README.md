# Viewing Your Bugcoins

## Your mined blocks are saved in a hidden file called .bugcoin in your home directory:

```bash
/data/data/com.termux/files/home/bugcoin/.bugcoin
```

## You can view it with:

```bash
cat ~/.bugcoin
```

Or use a web interface that reads .bugcoin and calculates total Bugcoins and USD value automatically.

Open the HTML web page (index.html) on your browser.
